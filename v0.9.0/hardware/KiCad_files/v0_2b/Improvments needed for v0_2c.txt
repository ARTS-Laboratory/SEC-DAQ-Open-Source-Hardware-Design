High importance
The files needs to be cleanded up, and put back into a single KiCad file.
Compress the board layout soe the DAQ sits inside the Arduino shield. (Reduces the wasted space)
Remove the ground tabs as adding a shield is a further work outside of these single box DAQs
Use a lower current draw opotcoupler, I think a CPC1301 should work. 

 
Medimum importance
Move trigger housing into the board so it does not hang over.
Change the surface mount D-sub to a edge mount D-sub with signal/sheild on top and ground on bottom. 
Add a switch for the time stamp so the DAQ only returns a time stamp if the switch in inabaled. Will require a 14 pin IDC connector.


Low importance 
Enlarge the CDC filter capacitor solder pads
Add LED to the trigger circuit to help with trouble shooting (check current draw problems)
